                        Introduction (by the character itself): <br>
                        “Ayo Tetsu here. You know the future greatest kyodai in history.<br>
                        My philosophy for life is simple. Live fast, strike first and help<br>
                        whoever needs it. I know it may sound crazy but if I were gloomy<br>
                        all the time I couldn’t enjoy all the good things and would just <br>
                        get all cranky and hyper focused on perfection. Nah it ain’t me.<br>
                        I don’t give into pressure from my lineage. I create it!<br>
                        So beware everybody cuz here goes Tetsuya Noroi ready to fight<br> 
                        and solve mysteries of the past, future and present day<br>
                        
                        Backstory:
                        Tetsuya came to life in a well known Noroi family. Thanks to his heritage he was well known around the village mostly for being related to Zandaka the grand kyodai candidate. Tetsuya's parents really tried to keep him safe but the young rebel couldn't be tempered when he heard about Zandaka’s adventures. Boy’s parents gave up after a lot of convincing but they still think the job of a kyodai is not  perfect for his future. 
                        Character:
                        Character arc: Overcoming self doubt, learning that all that matters is little moments and not big ones
                        Goal for the character: be the main fucking character. Explore self doubt, generational pressure from his ancestors and lineage, generational tension and much more family related themes because even though they’re all linked by blood they’re not really all that connected.
