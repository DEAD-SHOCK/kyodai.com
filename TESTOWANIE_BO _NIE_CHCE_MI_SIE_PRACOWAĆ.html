You know the future greatest kyodai in history. My philosophy for life is simple. Live fast, strike first and help whoever needs it. I know it may sound crazy but if I were gloomy all the time I couldn&rsquo;t enjoy all the good things and would just get all cranky and hyper focused on perfection. Nah it ain&rsquo;t me. I don&rsquo;t give into pressure from my lineage. I create it! So beware everybody cuz here goes Tetsuya Noroi ready to fight and solve mysteries of the past, future and present day</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Backstory:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Tetsuya came to life in a well known Noroi family. Thanks to his heritage he was well known around the village mostly for being related to Zandaka the grand kyodai candidate. Tetsuya&#39;s parents really tried to keep him safe but the young rebel couldn&#39;t be tempered when he heard about Zandaka&rsquo;s adventures. Boy&rsquo;s parents gave up after a lot of convincing but they still think the job of a kyodai is not &nbsp;perfect for his future. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Character:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Character arc: </span><span class="c5">Overcoming self doubt, learning that all that matters is little moments and not big ones</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Goal for the character: </span><span class="c5">be the main fucking character. Explore self doubt, generational pressure from his ancestors and lineage, generational tension and much more family related themes because even though they&rsquo;re all linked by blood they&rsquo;re not really all that connected.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.fb39eseyukif"><span class="c0">Kanyu</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kanyu types: </span><span class="c5">Creation, enhancement, transmutation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Known kanyu techniques: </span><span class="c5">Fudo, Sakusei, Myuto</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Abilities: </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Tetsuya creates a base suit of chainmail like fabric that enables him to create more specialized constructs like blades, hammers or some activate a different mode for a bit more gimmicky fighting style. A cool trick is that Tetsuya can actually create new limbs with this ability but they often lack precision as it needs more focus to operate them. In short this ability allows for strength and durability enhancement. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Noroi&rsquo;s armory act1: Street fight/</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">This mode focuses on basic fighting capabilities like kicking, punching and protecting himself, user can also create any weapon he wishes to make but the weapon can&#39;t separate from the user&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Bash gauntlets/Grzmoto&#322;apy: </span><span class="c5">Tetsuya can create a variation of gauntlets from normal ones that can stretch for better reach to big ones that have a lot more destructive power. the user can still choose if he wants to feel pain and touch in them but when he doesn&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re pretty clunky to operate. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Leap Kicks/Koposkoki: </span><span class="c5">Like &ldquo;Bash gauntlets&rdquo; Tetsuya can choose what kind of armor he wants to coat himself with and use it to either propel himself into the air or kick the enemy out of reach. Spikes can come from the sole for better gripping.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">When kicking and punching turn out not to be enough, Tetsuya still has other techniques that change his way of fighting drastically. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Buff ball</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">This is a very tanky mode that covers the user in thick armor and enables him to roll into a ball. This may sound like mobility in ball form is near zero but thanks to some creative thinking Tetsuya figured out a way to make it work. He uses an emission technique mixed with enhancement to propel himself through burst of aura coming out of layers of his shell that act as propelling engines that can either launch him or just make him move.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Reverse coating</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">This technique allows Tetsuya to use powerful energy blasts by turning his armor back into energy and using it for offense</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Noroi&rsquo;s armory act2: Elementalthrower </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">When Tetsuya realized pure physical attacks aren&rsquo;t always the best he created something more long ranged. In this mode his hands become two tubes from which elements of his choosing can shoot from if he mastered transmuting his aura into it. With basics he&rsquo;s able to uncontrollably make it just shoot but with more training he can make more creative things. Additionally from his back he gets two large cannons that help him either fly by bending air or shoot by loading big chunks of the ground and propelling it. On his legs he creates tube-like boots that can do essentially what the other parts do but it really helps with flying or sticking to surfaces. The possible elements this mode uses so far are Air, fire, lightning, earth, magnetism. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Noroi&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;armory act3: Titan clasher/Buster</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">This is Tetsuya&rsquo;s most powerful transformation where he combines all of his previous transformations and constructs and grows in size, becoming a brain of a giant mech. For this mode to fully function the user needs some kind of external battery to ensure stable and long duration of transformation when it grows more than 4 meters tall. In this mode everything is possible like wings, additional arms and even a tail to balance the mass</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.2h102a2hb4zz"><span class="c0">Extras</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">good and bad sides:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">+Good at improvising, adapting and creative aspects</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">+good at gaining allies </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">+</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">-Hot headed</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">-needs a lot of reassurance</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">-takes time to learn</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Likes/dislikes: </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">speech patterns:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">-oh scrap(a lot of scrap)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">-awwww man (THE catchphrase)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">-Dang it (Another catchphrase)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Relationship with others(voicelines)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">&#73750;About Shujin- he&#39;s a best friend of my uncle he can teach me how to be as great as him.

I clearly wasn&#39;t planned because my parents were already struggling to keep themselves alive. They quickly sold me to some shogun where they turned me into their little assassin but unfortunately it backfired because I ran away with their precious artifacts and began my life as a rogue kunoichi as they called me, personally I really like the title of &ldquo;thiefborn shadow&rdquo;. Now I wander around the world and search for quick money as a mercenary or some other unconventional profesional. Nowadays I try to live by law but I don&#39;t mind stealing from the rich. During my life I learned two things. One, that power gives freedom and two, that artifacts give power so I began to search for useful ones.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Backstory:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">She was born into a poor family as an accident and sold to the shogun of their land as a slave.

One which was given to her to fulfill the mission and the one she had to steal after killing the enemy shogun. After that she got adopted by a bunch of thieves that really liked how she can fit in places nobody would think of. They collaborated for 2 years only to disband after she stole all their loot and killed the guy she determined to be &ldquo;the scum of the earth&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Character:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">She has a pretty resonable but controversial philosophy of &ldquo;If it brings me profit but doesn&#39;t harm inocent people then i will do it&rdquo;.

Balance is the most important thing in existence because only through it we can remain at peace with nature, other people and our own selves. In the past I had troubles with keeping my own life at a safe balance between friend&rsquo;s, family, duty, and doing the right thing. Now &nbsp;I see that all of this was so trivial and ironically balanced. My life was so chaotic only for me to become a person who always seeks harmony. Now that I understand the world better I know that even if the sun is setting on the horizon it rises on the other side of the world. The boundaries of countries mean nothing because we&rsquo;re still all humans and if something endangers the safety of them I&rsquo;m willing to search for any way to avoid bloodshed even if it means shedding my own blood. I got recognized as the greatest living kyodai thanks to my achievements during the first Mashin war. After all everyone says I&rsquo;m the reason we haven&rsquo;t lost a single stone of our territory but should they really praise me so much? I wasn&rsquo;t able to save Ardneya&#39;s territory and so many people have died. But that&rsquo;s all in the past, I would be a fool if I thought that thinking about it now would bring me any good.

I don&#39;t want to waste your time so I&#39;ll keep it simple. I was born into a poor family bothered by debts of my grandparents. My father works as a factory worker and mother is a tailor but both of them combined wasn&#39;t enough to feed me and my two siblings so I dedicated my life to protecting them. When I was 12 I got recognized as a chemistry prodigy. I memorized all the known elements and compounds when I was working in a factory myself. Good people took care of our debt in exchange for me becoming a Mashin agent and working on really secret projects that I physically can&#39;t talk about. It was like a dream came but . . . Then my parents died in a fire protecting my sisters but the youngest one died from inhaling fumes from the burning roof. . . I&#39;m not as lonely as it may seem because I have Sash. She insisted on becoming an agent too so she trained physically really hard and became an agent too but it&#39;s a little bit more complicated than that. They used her in a project &ldquo;firewolf&ldquo; to boost her offensive capabilities and I&#39;m a little scared about the consequences of it but all I can do is support my sister because all we have is each other now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Backstory:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Character:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Character arc:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Goal for the character:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.ru3pxlhgds7n"><span class="c0">Kanyu</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Kanyu types: </span><span class="c5">Transmutation, parasitic, reality -bending (Sucks at all all the rest)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Known kanyu techniques: </span><span class="c5">all the fundamental ones</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Abilities:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sticky palms</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Allows the user to shoot any compound that she knows a structure of.

I will do anything I can to get my students through. From my birth I had a way with kanyu. But try to lay a finger on them and see my wrath. I wouldn&#39;t describe myself as such but people say I&#39;m a prodigy. What can i say i&#39;m just born different . . &nbsp;. Quite literally. My whole life I thought I achieved everything through hard work and perseverance but now that I learned it was all because of some mendling in my genes I feel weird. If i was a kid i would think it&#39;s pretty cool that I&rsquo;m a hybrid with special instincts but right now it feels wrong, as if my whole life was a lie. What&#39;s even more scary is that I learned what path I was set up to be and I&#39;m currently on it. . . I don&#39;t really want to go this path now that I know all of this. If there&#39;s a risk that I will repeat the mistakes of my creator, I think it&#39;s reasonable to give up my hopes and dreams . . . For greater good. I mean after the tournament of power I no longer can use kanyu the way i used to so i think it&#39;s the best way</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Backstory:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Leon was made as one of many Bjorn Osman clones but this particular one has only 1% of his DNA. Leonardo was created to become a better leader than Bjorn ever could be both physically and morally because &ldquo;he hopes with the wisdom of the universe&#39;s finest he will find a way that nobody else could ever see&rdquo;. The birth of Leon was thanks to the project &ldquo;GMEP&rdquo; (genetically modified enhanced people). Leon was one of a few that were given a made up story about his biological parents dying during a mission. In reality his &ldquo;parents&rdquo; or should i rather say some of the DNA donors were monitoring his growth. He spent his whole childhood in the orphanage and became the kids &ldquo;leader&rdquo;. He was the one that helped new kids accomodate to the new life. When Aiden ended up in the orphanage he was the one that guided her. They quickly became friends and helped each other to get through the difficult times. He did not know anything about his lineage but with time he discovered a lot of new abilities </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Character:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Character arc: </span><span class="c5">From the smartest and possibly best kanyu user to the powerless to the leader of the MKN </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Goal for the character: </span><span class="c5">A cool ass mentor figure.

He can use additional antennas from his sack to suck the energy from other sources anything he touches with them gets used as an energy source. Because of his immense understanding of innate abilities and kanyu he can absorb the very temperature of his environment to empower himself. During this state he gets access to his most powerful technique &ldquo;energy deficit&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Energy deficit</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">When it&#39;s activated Leo starts to absorb all energy in his surroundings. Whatever it&#39;s electricity or heat he stores it all. Additionally he can infuse his fists or a weapon with an aura that when in contact sucks even more kanyu. The downside of this technique is the extreme strain it puts on the body. 30 minutes in this state and the user will suffer full drawbacks of using max output, which means he will most likely never use kanyu ever again. Every punch sucks and expels sura at the same time which makes the users kanyu reserves fluctuate which leaves additional damage.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Energy annihilation</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">When user stores enough energy in the energy sack he can focus all of it and channel through a single body part (for example a finger) and unleash a powerful burst of energy that will annihilate any obstacle in its way. This attack will not only destroy a body part that is used but also force the body to use the max output. During a charge up kanyu gets sucked from other parts of the body quickly which can lead to necrosis. </span></p><h2 class="c4" id="h.xs18r7pxm0rk"><span class="c0">Extras</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">good and bad sides:</span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_qx140z5o8prw-0 start"><li class="c3 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">A great teacher</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_dyezcujom551-0 start"><li class="c3 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Has a hard time when he actually does something wrong</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Likes/dislikes: </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">speech patterns:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Random facts: </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Relationship with others(voicelines)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">about himself when DNA tests positive for suitorian DNA</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">&ldquo;I always knew I&rsquo;m special but this just gets weirder and weirder&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">To some scary guy</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">X: I heard about your performance during the infinite tournament.

class="c2">Backstory: </span><span>Kajdaiku was born in a family of foresters but when his mother died the father didn&rsquo;t take it lightly. One day young Kajdaiku at the ripe age of 8 broke a wooden fork. He was determined to fix his mistake so the next week he was carving a new utensil but he wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with it so he sneaked into a local blacksmith&rsquo;s house and &ldquo;borrowed some metal&rdquo;. His father was frequently leaving him there when he needed a babysitter so a boy knew more or less what to do. When everybody learned about what the boy did they were astonished. He was better than every single apprentice, he was faster, smarter more efficient and creative. His father and a blacksmith became intrigued and started to teach him a little bit more and more until he was better than his master at 15 years old. Boy was spending every single second of his free time learning more about this sacred art. Soon he got a chance to prove himself. A traveling warrior needed a new sword because his old one was made by a fraud and broke mid battle. He was hesitant but entrusted the forging to young Kajdaiku. It was the first time in his life when he saw such exotic and intricate materials. He spent a long time on the design and process it was his finest work yet he poured his whole heart and soul into it using every trick in his book until something awakened in him, in that moment all the worries left his body and all he was able to think about was the process, his faith in his abilities made the warrior exceed his wildest expectations. The sword was near unbreakable and sharper than any sword the warrior wielded before. He promised to recommend him to everyone he encounters as long as the sword won&rsquo;t fail him. As years went by more and more customers started to come to the young Noroi for the finest equipment in the country. He quickly gained more and more fame which he really liked. The king himself entrusted him a contract to </span><span>forge</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;him a royal sword and a suit of armor he would fight wars in. The prize was huge but the cost of failure was death. The king said &ldquo;If I die in this suit, the creator shall be treated the same way. Being suited in armor and killed the same way I died&rdquo;. Everybody was threatened to death. Such a risk at the line for one person such a stress, everybody was scared to even look at the proposal, but Kajdaiku just laughed and called it &ldquo;an easy money&rdquo;. And so he did forge as was told in a contract. For the first test king himself wanted to wear it and ordered a crossbow bolt to be shot precisely at his heart. Everybody was scared except Kajdaiku. When the bolt was fired it just glanced off the armor as if it was redirected by some mysterious force. From that point onwards Kajdaiku was titled as the &ldquo;Legendary blacksmith&rdquo;. He was taking care of his family until his father died when he was 21 from that point onwards he had to take care of his younger brother that himself started to make a name for himself as a world&rsquo;s greatest architecht</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Character:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Character arc:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Goal for the
